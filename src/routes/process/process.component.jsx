            <li>All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality.</li>
            <li>We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.</li>
            <li>As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.</li>
            <li>We require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product.</li>

        We take licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognised for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery
        will lead to immediate termination. Please reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.

          The process below is independent of the level. Payment is made in Bitcoin, USDT, USDC, DAI or aUSD. If you want to apply in private and/or you need to be paid out in fiat, you can apply here. Note that this is generally a slower process and
          imposes stricter requirements on applicants.

            <p>1. Fork the GitHub repository.</p>
            <p>
              2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template (applications/application-template.md). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the contents of the template inside
              the new one. Make sure you do not modify the template file directly. In the case of a maintenance application, use the maintenance template (maintenance template) instead.
            </p>
            <p>3. Name the new file after your project: project_name.md.</p>
            <p>
              4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Please refer to our Grant guidelines for most popular grant categories and make sure your deliverables present a similar
              same level of detail.
            </p>
            <p>5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain one new fileâ€”the Markdown file you created from the template.</p>
            <p>6. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.</p>
            <p>7. Sign off on the terms and conditions presented by the CLA assistant bot as a Contributor License Agreement. You might need to reload the pull request to see its comment.</p>

              weeks, the application will be closed due to inactivity, but you're always free to reopen it as long as it hasn't been rejected.

              the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

          Accepted grant applications can be amended at any time. However, this necessitates a reevaluation by the committee and the same number of approvals as an application (according to the levels). If your application has been accepted and,
          during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application. This also applies in case of significant delays.
        </li>
        <li>If your delivery schedule significantly changes, please also open a pull request with an updated timeline.</li>
        <li>
          If your deliveries are significantly delayed and we cannot get a hold of you, we will terminate the grant (3 approvals required, regardless of level. If a member of the committee creates the termination PR, only 2 more approvals are
          required).
